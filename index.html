        If you want to make a bot that uses this data, a JSON file is built from the data and can be found at:<br>
        <a href="https://ddm999.github.io/gt7info/data.json">ddm999.github.io/gt7info/data.json</a><br>
        This will update whenever the site is updated.<br>
        <br>
        <strong><small>All dates are (YY-MM-DD)</small><br>
        - Added stock performance data for non-Special BoP (ie. not Gr.1/2/3/4/B) cars. (23-05-01)<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Note: this data is currently slightly out-of-date [v1.29] but still gives a good performance guideline.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>This data is also available in JSON & CSV formats for importing to a spreadsheet!</small><br>
        - Content partially updated for v1.32. (23-04-28)<br>
        <br>
        <strong>Breaking data.json changes:</strong><br>
        - The `updatetimestamp` time is now derived from the GT7 update version. (The date is still accurate.)<br>
          This shouldn't break any existing bots, and will cause the timestamp to only change once per day OR when data is adjusted for a GT7 update.<br>
          This allows for bots to compare timestamps to determine whether to redownload data.<br>
        - `daysvisible` in a `car` entry has been removed. (22-06-28)<br>
        - A new setting for daily race `cartype` has been added: `pp`, for a PP limit. (22-06-20)<br>
        - A new setting for daily race `starttype` has been added: `grid_with_false_start`. (22-05-23)<br>
        - A new setting for daily race `cartype` has been added: `both`, for both a category and specific car restrictions. (22-05-02)<br>
        - The `estimatedays` field for dealership data has been adjusted to make more sense. (22-04-20) <small>It's now consistently "the days remaining shown on the site, plus one".</small><br>
        - Booleans have all been changed to actual booleans instead of y/n strings. (22-03-24)<br>
        - For a short time, daily race specific cars were given as db IDs: that's been reverted back to names. (22-04-04)<br>
